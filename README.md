This is an illustration of a Convolutional Neural Network that categorizes images into their appropriate classes. The code file provides explicit explanations for each command and tracks the progress of the code.

The code has been modified along the following points:
1- Change hyper parameters (Kernel size)
2- Add convolution and pooling
3- Change pooling to observe output
4. Change Dataset

I have demonstrated the process of creating a preliminary sketch for each layer and independently verifying the number of parameters to ensure the accuracy of the program in the Validating_Params.pdf file.
